![SEM Cycle](/assets/images/sem_cycle.png)

Search engine marketing, or SEM is one of the most effective ways to grow your business in a competitive online marketplace. With numerous competitors vying for the same "eyeballs", it's very important to advertise online in an effective and cost effecient way.  Search Engine Marketing is one of the most effective ways to promote your products and services while growing your business.

Moreover, Search engine marketing is the practice of marketing a business using paid advertisments that appear on search engine results pages or SERPs.  Advertisers bid on keywords that users of search engines services such as Google or Bing might enter when they are searching for specific products or services. This gives the advertiser an opportunity for their ads to appear alongside organic results for a search query.

These ads, also referred to as "pay-per-click ads", come in several different formats. Some are small, text-based ads, while others, such as product lising ads (PLAs, also known as shopping ads) are more visual, product-based advertisements that show potential customers "at a glance", a product visual, price and/or a product review.

One of the biggest advantages to search engine marketing is that it offers advertisers the opportunity to put their ads in front of motivated customers who are ready to buy at the precise moment they're ready to make a purchase.  No other advertising medium does this quite as well, which is in part why search engine marketing is so effective and such a powerful way to grow your business.

As with SEO, keyword are the foundation. As users enter keywords (as part of their search query) into search engines, such as Google or Bing, to find what they are looking for, results are then returned based on the keywords being utilized at the time.  Keywords are the basis for both SEO and SEM and keyword research and analysis are an integral part of your site's ability to reach perspective customers.
