<p>Search Engine Optimization is one of the basic ways that if implemented correctly, will drive traffic to your site.  It’s implementation is imperative and will help your site reach potential customers. However, along with keyword and competitive research , your sites content must contain what the searcher is looking for.. “Content is King”.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Maslow’s hierarchary of needs?  It’s simply a theory of psychology that priorities the most fundamental human needs (such as air, water and physical safety) as opposed to more advanceed needs (such as esteem and social belonging).  Simply put, you can’t achieve the needs at the top without ensuring that the more fundamental needs are met first. An example would be that most would be hard press to focus on “finding love”, if they have a more basic need of “finding food”.</p>

<p>You’re probably asking yourself by now, “How does this fit into SEO?”, well let’s dive a bit deeper to help you to see the correlation.</p>

<p>Let’s set the priorities of effective SEO efforts using a simple ordered list</p>

</ol>
